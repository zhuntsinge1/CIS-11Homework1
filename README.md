# My Thoughts

I woke up around 7AM today with a slight headache. I had a cup of coffee and drank some water and 
started to feel better shortly after. I probably didn't sleep too well and needed to re-hydrate. Overall,
I am starting to feel much better and look forward to spending some time working on this course. I
just ordered one of the books which should be here tomorrow and I am excited to get started. I think this
class will be challenging but with some patiece I think I will be able to pick it up. 

I just learned a tough lesson about development! I've learned this lesson before, but it must be one that keeps
on giving to computer users around the world. I was working on this homework task, I had completed 6 beautiful, elegant,
excellent, and perfect paragraphs while pushing git commits along the way. Unfortunately, I accidentally deleted
my Homework1 folder and lost the content :(. This was a huge blow as I had spent nearly an hour creating these paragraphs.
Lesson learned (again), always double check what you are removing before you remove it!

One of the shows I recently got into is on Amazon Prime called Outer Range. It's a science Fiction story about a group of 
ranchers in  Wyoming that find a time travelling hole in the ground. It sounds silly, but it is a really fun show 
with great effects and cinematography. The periods they travel to are not outlandish and the scenery is excellent. There
is a dark vibe in the show and some really cool plot twists along the way. I was sad to hear that they canceled the show
after th second season due to cost of production.

While examining Gradescope, I noticed there was a request missing that was not in the INSTRUCTIONS.md. I believe this was
done intentionally so that I have an opportunity to examine and understand how to properly use Gradescope effectively. I agree
with what you said that it may look confusing but if you know where to find the important information it is a very useful tool.
I promise not to forget that all future assignments may be heavily penalized for failure to commit frequently as I do my work.

I need more commits, so I am going to talk about the other classes I am taking this semester. Along with this class, I am taking a 
US History class as well as CIS-7. CIS-7 and this class both seem somewhat tough. What even is discreet math?! One of the issues I 
am facing is I took cis-5 Last fall. While it was a good enough course, it wasn't very in depth or hands on. I was able to pass it ok
and I only struggled a little, but since I have touched C++ since then, I feel some trepidation diving into these two courses. I do think
that with some patience and the willingness to focus then I should be able to accomplish passing both of them. I think both teachers
offer a lot of guidance and support as well. 

My current job is working for a web hosting provider. I have been working there for about 8 years now and it has become something
I really enjoy doing. We mostly work with the average consumer so the most popular application we support is WordPress. It is 
the easiest tool for the average person to pick up and create a website. Most of our customers are hobbyists or small business owners, 
but we also support other softwares like Python, Ruby, Node, etc. My employer is a big proponent of continued education and they
are fully supportive in me returning to school and learning new things. It is a huge relief when you don't have to sacrifice your
current job or employment to go back to school!
