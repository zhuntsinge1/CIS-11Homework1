# My Thoughts

I woke up around 7AM today with a slight headache. I had a cup of coffee and drank some water and 
started to feel better shortly after. I probably didn't sleep too well and needed to re-hydrate. Overall,
I am starting to feel much better and look forward to spending some time working on this course. I
just ordered one of the books which should be here tomorrow and I am excited to get started. I think this
class will be challenging but with some patiece I think I will be able to pick it up.
