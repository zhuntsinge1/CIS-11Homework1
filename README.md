# My Thoughts

I woke up around 7AM today with a slight headache. I had a cup of coffee and drank some water and 
started to feel better shortly after. I probably didn't sleep too well and needed to re-hydrate. Overall,
I am starting to feel much better and look forward to spending some time working on this course. I
just ordered one of the books which should be here tomorrow and I am excited to get started. I think this
class will be challenging but with some patiece I think I will be able to pick it up. 

I just learned a tough lesson about development! I've learned this lesson before, but it must be one that keeps
on giving to computer users around the world. I was working on this homework task, I had completed 6 beautiful, elegant,
excellent, and perfect paragraphs while pushing git commits along the way. Unfortunately, I accidentally deleted
my Homework1 folder and lost the content :(. This was a huge blow as I had spent nearly an hour creating these paragraphs.
Lesson learned (again), always double check what you are removing before you remove it!
